**Project Proposal: Movie Watchlist App**

### **1\. Project Overview**

The Movie Watchlist App is a full-stack web application that allows users to search for movies, save them to a personal watchlist, and view basic movie details. The app integrates The Movie Database (TMDB) API to fetch movie information and follows RESTful principles to ensure a structured backend. Users can create accounts, manage their watchlist, and access stored data via PostgreSQL.

### **2\. Objectives**

* Demonstrate the ability to build a full-stack application with React and Node.js.  
* Implement a RESTful API with authentication.  
* Allow users to add and remove movies from their watchlist.  
* Store user data and watchlists in a PostgreSQL database.  
* Ensuring core functionalities work seamlessly.

### **3\. Key Features**

* **User Authentication:** Sign-up, login, and logout functionality using JWT authentication.  
* **Movie Search:** Fetch movies from TMDB API.  
* **Watchlist Management:** Users can add and remove movies from their personal watchlist.  
* **Movie Details Page:** Display basic details like title, poster, and summary.  
* **Responsive UI:** Optimized for both desktop and mobile users.

### **4\. Tech Stack**

* **Frontend:** React.js (React Router, Context API for state management)  
* **Backend:** Node.js with Express.js (RESTful API implementation)  
* **Database:** PostgreSQL (to store user watchlists)  
* **Authentication:** JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure user sessions  
* **API Integration:** TMDB API for fetching movie data  
* **Deployment:** Frontend on Render, Backend on Render

### **5\. User Flow**

1. **Homepage:** Users can browse trending movies fetched from TMDB.  
2. **Signup/Login:** Users create an account or log in to save watchlists.  
3. **Search:** Users can search for a movie title.  
4. **Movie Details:** Displays essential information like title, poster, and description.  
5. **Watchlist Management:** Users can add or remove movies from their watchlist.  
6. **Logout:** Ends the user session securely.

### **6\. Development Roadmap**

**Phase 1: Setup & API Integration**

* Set up backend (Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL)  
* Configure TMDB API integration

**Phase 2: Authentication & User Management**

* Implement JWT authentication  
* Create signup and login endpoints

**Phase 3: Core Functionality**

* Develop movie search and details page  
* Implement watchlist feature

**Phase 4: UI/UX Enhancements**

* Ensure responsive design  
* Add styling and user-friendly navigation

**Phase 5: Testing & Deployment**

* Conduct testing  
* Deploy frontend and backend

### **7\. Expected Outcomes**

* A functional movie watchlist web app.  
* Secure authentication system with RESTful API.  
* Real-time movie data integration via TMDB API.  
* Scalable architecture for potential future enhancements.

### **8\. Conclusion**

This project balances simplicity with essential full-stack development principles. It ensures the demonstration of RESTful API design, authentication, database integration, and dynamic front-end interaction without overcomplicating the development process.
