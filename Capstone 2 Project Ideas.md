**Capstone 2 Project Ideas**

**\#1 Movie Recommendation App:**

Many people struggle to find movies and TV shows that they’re interested in.  With the vast number of films and TV shows available, choosing the right one can be overwhelming.  This project aims to create a personalized recommendation system that makes movie / TV show suggestions based on a user’s watch history, favorite genre, and/or preferred actors. By using publicly available movie data, ratings, and user’s preferences, the application will help users find things to watch that are tailored to their tastes. **The primary data source for this project will be The Movie Database (TMDb) API, which provides extensive movie details, ratings, and recommendations.** 

**\#2 Movie / TV Show Streaming Locator**

Finding where to stream a particular movie or TV show can be frustrating, especially with content spread across multiple platforms.  Users often waste time searching different services to check for availability.  This project will help with this problem by creating a streaming guide that allows users to search for any movie / TV show and see where it is available to stream. **This project will utilize data from the TMDb and Watchmode API’s to provide up to date information to the user.** 

**\#3 Affirmation, Journaling, and Mood Tracking App**

Many people struggle with maintaining a positive mindset and understanding their emotional patterns over time.  This project aims to create a personal mental wellbeing app that provides users with daily positive affirmations while allowing them to journal their thoughts / feelings and tracks their mood trends.  Users can browse affirmations by category, save their favorites, and log their mood using icons. **The primary source for this project will be the Affirmations API, while the journaling and mood tracking will be custom based and stored in a database.**
